	<p>Typically youâ€™ll notice dropped capitals appear in printed
		mediums, such as newspapers and books. However this can also be a neat
		effect in webpages or blogs where there is enough extra room in the
		layout. This CSS rule is targeting all paragraphs but you may limit
		this based on a single class or ID.</p>
